    <h2>Projects </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Unnormalized spectral clustering algorithm : The project aims to Develop Python implementation of unnormalized spectral clustering algorithm using Python interface and C API wrapper. Utilizes eigenvectors for data clustering, aiming for a scalable integration into Python applications.</li>
        <li>Implementing AVL trees :this programming research project focuses on data structures, specifically an AVL tree implementation of a list, using Python. It comprises two main components: a practical implementation involving the creation of a list using an AVL tree, and an experimental and theoretical section, where theoretical analysis and research questions are explored based on the practical implementation. The project aims to investigate and evaluate the AVL tree structure in the context of programming.</li>
        <li>Implementing Hash Tables :The project was developed utilizing Python and focused on the implementation of hash tables employing open addressing techniques such as linear probing, quadratic probing, and double hashing. The primary objective was to delve into and compare the various iterations of the open addressing approach within hash tables.</li>
        <li>Starfleet Command : In this project, I developed a software system, "Starfleet Command", using Java, for future space fleet management, involving the construction of classes representing team members and various spacecraft types using interfaces, abstract classes, and inheritance. </li>
        <li>Enhancing Single Cycle mips processor: I enhanced the single cycle mips processor by adding support for additional commands through modifications to the control units, data paths or the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), using the Logisim application.</li>
    </ul>
